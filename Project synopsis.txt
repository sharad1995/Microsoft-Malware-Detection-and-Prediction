In this project, our goal was to develop a machine learning model to predict and detect malware infections in Windows machines. We used the same dataset provided by the Microsoft Malware Prediction and Detection competition on Kaggle, which contained over 8 million files with labeled malware and non-malware samples.

To develop our model, we employed the LightGBM algorithm, which is a gradient boosting framework that uses decision trees to model the data. We also performed feature selection using two techniques: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest Classifier and correlation analysis. RFE is a technique that recursively removes features and builds a model to determine the most important features for the model. Correlation analysis measures the degree of association between variables and identifies the features that are highly correlated with the target variable.

We also used LabelEncoder() to convert character data into numerical data. LabelEncoder() is a preprocessing technique that assigns a numerical label to each unique value in a categorical feature. This allows the algorithm to process the categorical data as numerical data and enables us to include this information in our model.

Using these techniques, we developed a model with high accuracy and precision in detecting and predicting malware infections. Our model achieved an AUC score of 0.85 on the test dataset, indicating its ability to correctly distinguish between malware and non-malware samples.

Overall, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of using LightGBM, feature selection techniques such as RFE and correlation analysis, and preprocessing techniques such as LabelEncoder() for predicting and detecting malware infections in Windows machines. This approach can help improve the security and safety of computer systems by enabling early detection and prevention of malware infections.
